The document describes the professional \r\nactivities and areas of professional practice. The Scope of Inspection \r\ndefines the minimum standard of practice for all HIA home inspections in\r\n British Columbia. The scope of work of an individual home inspector \r\nmust meet the requirements outlined in this document but may include \r\nadditional inspection services where the home inspector is qualified and\r\n / or has special knowledge. The scope of the home inspector’s review of\r\n a home is a contractual matter, therefore, any additional services \r\nprovided to the client beyond the Scope of Inspection, must be \r\ncommunicated through a contractual agreement with the client.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(100, 108, 154);\">The\r\n working premise of this document is that licensed home inspectors will \r\ndemonstrate minimum, entry level competencies and will conduct their \r\nwork competently in a variety of home inspection environments. The \r\npractice requirements represent the expectations of a “typical” not an \r\n“expert” home inspector. A specialist may be hired to provide additional\r\n analysis and opinion of adverse conditions or defects identified, \r\nbeyond this Scope of Inspection.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(100, 108, 154);\">A\r\n home inspection is a limited, non-invasive, visual examination of the \r\ncurrent condition of a residential building. A home inspection is \r\ndesigned to report observed deficiencies within specific systems and \r\ncomponents of a home. A home inspection provides a description of the \r\ncondition of the home based on observation of the visible and apparent \r\ncondition of the structure and components at the time of the home \r\ninspection. A home inspection does not guarantee future condition, \r\nefficiency, or life expectancy of systems or components. It is not an \r\ninspection to verify compliance with any applicable building codes, \r\nmunicipal bylaws or other regulations. A home inspection will not reveal\r\n every problem that exists or could ever exist and is not a technically \r\nexhaustive inspection.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(100, 108, 154);\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">HIABC CODE OF ETHICS</span></p><p style=\"color: rgb(100, 108, 154);\">Honesty,\r\n justice, and courtesy form a moral philosophy which, associated with \r\nmutual interest among people, constitutes the foundation of ethics.

It is their duty \r\nto practice the profession according to this code of ethics.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(100, 108, 154);\">As\r\n the keystone of professional conduct is integrity, the Members will \r\ndischarge their duties with fidelity to the public, their clients, and \r\nwith fairness and impartiality to all.
